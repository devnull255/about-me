## Background
I develop applications, tools and frameworks primarily in the Unix and Linux DevOps space though I have also done a lot of work in the mainframe and windows environments as well.  My work throughout the years has focused heavily on the development of developer productivity tools, including code generators and wrappers, as well as scripting frameworks to support batch execution of data analytic tools and testing.  I am currently working on the development of tools, workflows and libraries used in our build and release environment. In my spare time I work on my own open source projects, play with Raspberry Pi and Arduino, write and record music in my home studio.
